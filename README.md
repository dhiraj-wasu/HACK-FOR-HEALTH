HELLO FOLKS !!!
In this project we creates a website that helps to predict the meaternal health status
This does so by using a ML model in backend

PURPOSE-
India is a country that is rapidly prospering on the one hand, but a large majority of its citizens still lack access to basic medical care. Child mortality rates in rural India are high, with nearly 100 out of every 1,000 children dying before their fifth birthday. Almost half of those children die within the firstmonth after birth. Even maternal deaths are prominant of about 25,220 deaths in 2020. Women's lack of access to resources and education is a significant, problem that contributes to infant mortality. Other factors affecting this is the social status of women the caste system and many unknown factors.

FEATURES-
To solve this problem we created a website. In this website we try to predict the maternal health status by taking simple inputs that can be detected even at small hospitals.The website uses a pre trained ML model to hence predict the status as (Low risk, Mide risk, High risk). It also gives some general health tips to be followed.

USAGE:
  - click on the website link
  - enter basic input asked
  - click predict
  - see the result and some health tips
OR
  - download the repo and extract all the files
  - install the libraries(numpy, pandas, django, sklearn, matplotlib) using requirement.txt 
  - now open the folder  in vs and run this 'python manage.py runserver'  and follow the instruction given on the pages
  - input the parameters and see the result ( may delay due model )

NOTE - the hosting of the website was not possible due to various techinical errors. we tried our best to host the website but were not able to do so. kindly follow the second part of the usage.
HAPPY LEARNING :))
